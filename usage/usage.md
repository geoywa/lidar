# Usage

The images below show real-world examples of the level set method for
delineating nested depressions in the Cottonwood Lake Study Area (CLSA),
North Dakota. More test datasets (e.g., the Pipestem watershed in the
Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota) can be downloaded from
<http://gishub.org/2019-JAWRA-Data>

The following example was conducted on a 64-bit Linux machine with a
quad-core Intel i7-7700 CPU and 16 GB RAM. The average running time of
the algorithm for this DEM was 0.75 seconds.
